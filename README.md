HackerRank solutions in Go

Solutions are not tested on HackerRank.
I just use this as training and experimentation playground.

Many solutions are re-coded Go versions of algorithms from other languages.

Most experiments are attempts to use functional programming and/or other Go specific techniques.
Some attempts are *crazy* mental acrobatics and you should not use them in production.
